## Marijuana Information and Trip Planning App

A project by Saige and Jesse

### Description of Project

We built a CLI app in Ruby, that allows users to learn information about which American states have medical/recreational marijuana. In addition, they have the ability to create an account and plan a trip to desired locations, while saving their informationa and trips to a database.

### Process

The first step involved scraping a website that covers marijuana legalities state by state. We used HTTParty and Nokogiri to get and parse the data pertinent to the project's design. This was the information that was then used to seed our database with. Creation of the CLI interface was the final phase.

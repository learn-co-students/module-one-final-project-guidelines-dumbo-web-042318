# Install
Simply clone down this repo, cd in and do: 

`$ ruby bin/run.rb`  

Feel free to alias that, it's the faster way. 

# Overview 
LeanLogr is great for storing questions that might not fit nicely into your regular notes. Each new "note" here is posed as a 
question and answer. You can also add links to the sites where you found the answer, as well as tags to help you organize everything.

# How to use 
You have 6 options at start up. To access every command here (and everywhere in the app) type in either the number, letter, or words you need to, and then hit enter. And some screens simply need you to press enter to move along. Here are the main options:

1. Add question/answer/link/tags
2. Show All questions/answers/links/tags
3. Show all question by tag
4. Add new links and tags to question
5. Update question and answer
6. Delete a question/answer/link/tag

(and q to exit)

### Option 1: Add everything 
You will be prompted to type in your question, then the answer, along with as many links and tags as you want. You will be asked if you want to add another link and tag after each one, so don't worry, getting out of it is easy

### Option 2: See it all 
You can see all your questions, answers, links, and tags. 

### Option 3: Sort by tag 
Each Q/A can have tags, this is where you can see all your tags, and then see any questions related to those tags. Tags tags tags. 

### Option 4: Add stuff 
Sometimes you want to add stuff to your stuff. Good. You can easily add new links and tags to any of your questions.

### Option 5: Edit questions 
Did you learn a new thing? Wonderful! You can easily edit both the question and the answer to reflect your new knowledge. 

### Option 6: Destroy it! 
Ashamed of a dumb question? We understand, sometimes things become obvious in hindsight. Delete your shame with option six for every question you don't like.
